# myIdeas
a small list of my coding ideas 

# Site to allow junior devs to connect with eachother and collaborate on projects
this site will also have project ideas, and profiles for all developers trying to use it

# Full site to help the organization of golf courses
this will include things like tip counters, scheduling, reminders, eventually tee time making, bag room info, as well as a place for the pro shop and the bag room to talk

# Site that helps fit people for the correct golf clubs and shafts
pretty self explanitory and wont be that hard outside of the massive amount of research that i will need to do lol

# Ecom site just to test my skills
another self explanitory one but it will serve as a sort of template for future sites that i may build

# App that tracks where you are in the application process 
allows you to track your applications sent, as well as keep notes for each stage and show you the exact application that you sent to the company

# Car data scraper
This application will show people all the specs of their desired car based on year and model, and will allow them to be compared and saved. Finally it will pull in other sites data and allow you to search a database. 

# A visual coding lofi app 
shows cool visuals that go with your lofi music, this will be intigrated with a pomodoro timer, and will have a set playlist 

# Golf dating app
This app will allow golfers to connect and eventually meet eachother on the course where their first date will be a round of golf

# Various SPA product sites
for friends 

# build my own crypto 

# A bot for getting tickets to broadway shows 
This will allow people who are attempting to see broadway shows have an easier time getting their tickets as they are very saught after

# A truly good readMe builder and visualizer tool. These things are so annoying to make, and there needs to be a site with some good templates and that visually shows the developer whats happening in their markdown language 
pretty self explanatory
